LIBRARIES

This Repoitory comes with pre-built W64 libraries for openssl, curl and pcre
in `usr/lib`. The sources are also shipped in archived files under `src/`.

If you need to rebuild one of the libraries you'll have to do the following:
- remove the corresponding lib file in `usr/lib/lib*.a`. The build system 
  will then extract the sources and rebuild the library from scratch. Remove
  - libpcre.a to rebuild pcre
  - libcurl.a to rebuild pcre
  - libssl.a to rebuild pcre
- if you want to build a newer version of a library, download the source 
  archive into the src/ folder 
- open `src/Makefile`. look for a `*_VERSION` variable at the beginning of 
  the file. Replace the version number with the one used in your download 
  file name.
- go back into the main folder and run `make`. If you have delete the 
  `usr/lib/lib*.a` file, the library will be rebuilt from scratch.
  - you may also just build the library by running from `src/`
    - `make pcre`
    - `make openssl`
    - `make curl`
  - then got back into the root directory and run make to build the app with 
    the new library
