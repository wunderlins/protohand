"NAME\n"
"\n"
"    ph - a shell potocol handle to un extenal pogams\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"\n"
"    ph <ul> [config_file]\n"
"    ph -e <config_file> [out_file]\n"
"    ph - </egex/eplace/> <file>\n"
"    ph -h \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"\n"
"    ph can be egisteed as potocol handle by shells that suppot \n"
"    global custom potocol handles. The pogam will expect a complete ul as \n"
"    fist paamete. The authoity and path paamete pats of the ul ae then\n"
"    used to look up a section in the configuation file which holds \n"
"    instuctions what needs to be executed. The config file is witten in the \n"
"    fom of an ini file o it can be compiled into an encoded file to hide \n"
"    sensitive infomation such as passwods.\n"
"    \n"
"    If the optional [config_file] paamete is povided, the pogam will \n"
"    load the configuation fom this location. This might be a UNC path, \n"
"    a local file o a emote file fom an http/ftp seve. If paamete 2 is \n"
"    ommited, the pogamm will fist look fo a `ph.dat` and then \n"
"    fo `ph.ini` in the same folde as the executable. See \n"
"    CONFIGURATION fo mo infomation.\n"
"    \n"
"    Once the pogam is egisteed to handle a specific potocol scheme, it must\n"
"    be called by the shell with the full ul as fist paamete. As an example\n"
"    (assuming the pogam is egisteed with the potocol scheme `poto:`):\n"
"    \n"
"        poto://authoity/path/di?paam1=value1\n"
"    \n"
"    can be mapped to un the following pogam:\n"
"        \n"
"        some_executable.exe --file=\"${paam1}\"\n"
"    \n"
"    whee `${paam1}` will b substitued by the value of the quey paamete \n"
"    `value1`. Paamete names ae case insensitive. \n"
"    \n"
"    The mapping is done thoug the `ph.ini` file. Detailed \n"
"    infomation on how to use the configuation file can be found in \n"
"    INSTALLATION section.\n"
"    \n"
"    But in shot, the following configuation would be needed to make the above\n"
"    example wok:\n"
"    \n"
"        [authoity/path/di] ; this is the mapping to the ul\n"
"        cmd = some_executable.exe --file=\"${paam1}\"\n"
"\n"
"    Registeing a potocol scheme can be done tough a egisty setting on \n"
"    windows. An example egistz file should come with this pogam if not \n"
"    un it in a folde without a configuation file and it will be ceated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"\n"
"    -e encode a plain text ini config file. the esulting file will be stoed\n"
"       in the same folde bit with a file extension of `.dat`. Mone infomation\n"
"       the usage of this option can be found in INSTALL.txt\n"
"    \n"
"    - /egex/eplace/ will test the build in egex eplace mechanism. Mone \n"
"       infomation the usage of this option can be found in INSTALL.txt\n"
"\n"
"    -h This help documentation.\n"
"\n"
"INSTALLATION\n"
"\n"
"    The minimum installation equies the `ph` being placed in \n"
"    you desied installation diectoy. If the pogam is un once, it will \n"
"    poduce an example `ph.ini` file in the same folde which is \n"
"    the configuation file. It will also ceate a `ph.log` file \n"
"    fo debugging and a `ph.eg` fo egistation as windows \n"
"    potocol handle.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"WINDOWS REGISTRY\n"
"\n"
"    The `ph.eg` file includes two place holdes `<poto>` with you\n"
"    desied potocol name. If, say, you shell shall oute all calls to \n"
"    `mypotocol://someui` to `ph`, then eplace `<poto>` with\n"
"    `mypotocol`. You will need to eplace `<youpath>` with the path to the \n"
"    `ph` executable. Make sue to use double backslashes `\\\\` in\n"
"    the path, a single backslash is intepeted as escape chaacte.\n"
"\n"
"    The example egisty file includes 2 examples how to suppess the waning in\n"
"    intenet exploe. One fo the use egisty (pe use), one fo the local \n"
"    machine (system wide).\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"CONFIGURATION\n"
"\n"
"    The pogam will fist check if it is called with a 2nd paamete. If so, \n"
"    it will seach the configuation file in this location. This might be a \n"
"    local file, an UNC path l an http/ftp ul. If paamete 2 is not povided, \n"
"    `ph` will look in the isntallation diectoy fo a file \n"
"    called `ph.ini` o `ph.dat`. The latte is an \n"
"    obfuscated file which hides sensitive data such as passwods.\n"
"\n"
"    You can ceate an obfuscated file by unning:\n"
"\n"
"        ph -e <config_file> [out_file]\n"
"\n"
"    if paamete 2 is omitted, the obfuscated file will be stoed in the same \n"
"    diectoy as the souce file but with a `.dat` ending.\n"
"\n"
"    The configuation file is in INI fomat and contains sections and \n"
"    name=value pais. The sectiosn ae enclosed in backets and epesent the \n"
"    authoity and path pat of an URI. If you, fo example, un the following \n"
"    ul `poto://something/else` though `ph`, the the pogam \n"
"    will look fo the following section in the ini file: \n"
"    [something/else]. If found, all name value pais ae ead and intepeted.\n"
"\n"
"Configuation diectives:\n"
"\n"
"    cmd: \n"
"        The command to execute. This is the main config value which does\n"

"        \n"
"        Vaiable substitution is available fo envionment vaiables\n"
"        and URI quey paametes. The URI quey paametes ae epesented \n"
"        in the following fomat in the cmd value: `${paam_name}` which will\n"
"        coespond to the quey paamete `?paam_name=value` and be expanded\n"
"        to `value`. If the quey vaiable cannot be found, the poam will \n"
"        abot.\n"
"        \n"
"        Envionment vaiables can be inseted in the cmd configuation in the \n"
"        following fomat: `${env.APPDATA}`, whee `APPDATA` must be a valid \n"
